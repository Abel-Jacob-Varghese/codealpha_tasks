# ✅ **Task 2 — Unemployment Analysis with Python**

### **Objective:**  
Analyze unemployment trends across India and understand changes during the COVID-19 period.

### **What I Did:**
- Cleaned and preprocessed unemployment data  
- Converted dates and removed null or inconsistent values  
- Performed state-wise and region-wise unemployment analysis  
- Analyzed rural vs urban unemployment  
- Created trend visualizations and correlation heatmaps  
- Exported cleaned dataset

### **Key Insights:**
- Sharp unemployment spike during early 2020 (COVID impact)  
- Northern & Eastern states reported higher unemployment  
- Urban unemployment was slightly higher than rural  
- Gradual stabilization seen toward late 2020  

### **Skills Used:**  
`Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `EDA`

# 🚗 **Task 3 — Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning**

### **Objective:**  
Predict the selling price of used cars based on features like present price, car age, kilometers driven, fuel type, and transmission.

### **What I Did:**
- Cleaned and explored the car dataset  
- Engineered “Car Age” feature from manufacturing year  
- Encoded categorical columns (Fuel, Transmission, Seller Type)  
- Trained **Linear Regression** and **Random Forest Regressor**  
- Compared model accuracy using R², MAE, RMSE  
- Generated feature importance and prediction visualizations  
- Exported cleaned data and predicted outputs

### **Key Insights:**
- Present Price & Car Age have the strongest influence on resale value  
- Diesel and automatic cars typically have higher resale price  
- Random Forest captured non-linear relationships better  
- Linear Regression performed reliably (R² ≈ 0.74)

### **Skills Used:**  
`Pandas`, `Scikit-Learn`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `Feature Engineering`

# 📈 **Task 4 — Sales Prediction Using Machine Learning**

### **Objective:**  
Predict product sales based on advertising budgets across TV, Radio, and Newspaper.

### **What I Did:**
- Cleaned the Advertising dataset  
- Conducted EDA: correlations, feature relationships  
- Built and compared **Linear Regression** & **Random Forest** models  
- Created scatter plots, actual vs predicted plots, residual analysis  
- Exported cleaned dataset and prediction results  
- Automated saving of all visualizations

### **Key Insights:**
- TV and Radio advertising have the strongest effect on sales  
- Newspaper spending shows weak correlation  
- Random Forest achieved very high accuracy (R² ≈ 0.98)

### **Skills Used:**  
`Pandas`, `Scikit-Learn`, `Seaborn`, `Matplotlib`, `Regression Models`
